<p><a href="index.html">Main Logistics Page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<h2 id="online-courses"><a name="introduction"></a>Online Courses</h2>
<p>As you all probably know, the University is transitioning to <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus/faq#students">online courses</a> for the foreseeable future. As we navigate this challenging time, we will do our best to continue learning as best we can. This page provides information on how the course will proceed beginning Thursday, March 19.</p>
<h2 id="lectures"><a name="lectures"></a>Lectures</h2>
<p>Course lectures will be recorded ahead of time, and posted on Collab under the &quot;Lecture Capture&quot; tool. The lectures will be posted <strong>before the date of lecture</strong>. The expectation is that you will watch the recorded lecture during our normal class period (MW 11-11:50). Because of the lack of interaction, I expect that the lecture recordings will be shorter than the full 50 minutes (probably 30-40 minutes each on average).</p>
<p><strong>Why aren't we using Zoom (or similar) for lectures?</strong> I strongly considered this, but I'm concerned with technological problems disrupting the delivery of course material. For this reason, I'd like to produce &quot;clean&quot; lecture videos to deliver the material and we will use more interactive methods for Office Hours and other aspects of the course (see below).</p>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a name="oh"></a>Office Hours</h2>
<p>Office hours will be held using <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. There is a link on our Collab page (the link is called <strong>Online Meetings</strong>). Floryan and the TAs will post a meeting room inside this tool for each individual OH session. By simply clicking on the link, you can access the meeting room, ask questions, get help, etc.</p>
<p>I will be changing my office hours a bit. Check the <a href="index.html">main course logistics page</a> for details. The office hours listed there are for Game Design students only.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks"><a name="hw"></a>Homeworks</h2>
<p>Homework assignments remain unchanged. You should continue to submit your assignments on Collab as usual every Friday at 6pm. The course schedule <strong>has</strong> changed (several assignments were pushed back). See the <a href="grading.html">grading page</a> for details. You are responsible for communicating with your teams and working out the logistics of productive remote work.</p>
<h2 id="labs"><a name="labs"></a>Labs</h2>
<p>Instead of meeting in person for labs as a large group, your team will be responsible for meeting with a TA each week and presenting your progress. Floryan will sit-in on a subset of these meetings each week. Your TA will create a meeting on <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. This link will appear on Collab (under &quot;Online Meetings&quot;). Attendance will be taken and anyone who does not attend this meeting will be poisoned. The meetings are during your normal lab time (so everyone is able to attend) and will be quite short (about 20 minutes). During this meeting, each sub-team will show the TA progress and receive feedback on their game. There will also be a discussion about integration and how your group is proceeding with handing off parts of the code across teams (e.g., the development tool).</p>
<p>This week (<strong>Thursday, March 19</strong>), we will hold a practice lab to make sure we all understand this process and to work out any issues. Next week (<strong>Thursday, March 26</strong>) we will begin our first &quot;real&quot; lab meeting.</p>
<p>The breakdown of games, TAs, and meeting times is shown below.</p>

<p>Our exam schedule remains unchanged. There will still be a short, multiple-choice take-home final at the end of the semester. You are still required to read the assigned book before then.</p>
