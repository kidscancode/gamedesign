<p>This course is almost completely project based. Thus, the grading is almost completely determined by how well your group does on the project. The project has exactly 24 parts. The first two are done individually and the other 22 are done in groups (though most groups will split into three teams and do approximately 7 of the 22 themselves while working with their teammates. For each project part, one of three grades will be assigned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsatisfactory:</strong> The work is not up to our standard for this course.</li>
<li><strong>Competency:</strong> The work is not up to our standards, but is acceptable as a minimum viable submission.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfied:</strong> The work is at or above the standard we expect for this course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your final letter grade is established by looking on the following chart at how many of the project parts were satisfied. This can raise your grade as high as a B+.</p>
<p>There will be a short, multiple choice final exam (about 60 questions or so). If you earn above a 60 percent, your grade rises one half letter grade. If you earn above an 80%, your grade rises two half letter grades.</p>
<p>Attendance is taken in lecture at random. If your name is selected randomly and you are not present, then you will be poisoned. Poisoning causes one of your assignments to be demoted (from satisfied to competent). Thus, be advised to not skip lecture when possible.</p>
