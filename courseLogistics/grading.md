CS4730 - Game Design Grading Policy
===============================

[Main Logistics Page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

In this course, all assignments are simply pass/fail. If your submission achieves our requirements than you earn a pass, otherwise you fail. All assignments are resubmittable as many times as you'd like before some common deadlines (see the homeworks page for information on deadlines.).

There are three types of assignment in this course:

- **Primary Game Dev:** Individual assignments that ensure you have learned the primary skills in Unity and in game development.
- **Project Parts:** The group project is submitted in four parts (design document, alpha, beta, final builds).
- **Optional Points:** A range of optional points available through small features, activities, etc. These build on the primary game dev assignments above.

Your grade in the course is based on how many of the assignments you pass versus don't pass. The chart below summarizes this. A green box means you have passed that assignment. For the primary game dev assignments, the grade is based on which specific assignments are passed. For the project and optional assignments, the grade is based on the proportion of the assignments that are passed.
