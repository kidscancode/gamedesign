<h2 id="overview"><a name="background"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>For the second part of your project, you will be developing a short, playable demo of your build. The overall goal is to produce a <strong>fully playable game</strong> from start to finish. The game will be short however. This means that all of your primary mechanics will be fully implemented and working. Your game will have a start screen, winning and losing conditions, etc.</p>
<p>A reasonable litmus test for what we expect is this: <em>Imagine you are releasing a free demo version of your game to entice players to purchase the full version. This alpha build should serve as a short playable demo that serves this purpose</em>. Here are some examples of what this might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>for a platforming game like Mario</strong>: A start screen, a short narrative hook (e.g., &quot;they took the princess!&quot;), and one or two fully playable levels.</li>
<li><strong>for a Pokemon type game</strong>: A start screen, collect one pokemon, fight one or two battles, conclude somehow.</li>
<li><strong>for a puzzle game</strong>: Start screen, and 3 or 4 short puzzle levels.</li>
<li><strong>for a metroid-like game</strong>: Start screen, a room or two showing obstacles, one power-up pickup, overcome an obstacle and reach an ending room (with perhaps a short &quot;boss battle&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements"><a name="required"></a>Requirements</h2>
<p>The graders will be checking that the following requirements are met for your game. You will pass this assignment if all of these are implemented to a reasonable level.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Fully Playable Game</strong>: Your game needs to be a fully playable game. We expect your games at this point to be short (maybe 1-3 minutes of gameplay total). However, the game should be fully completable from beginning to end, including final win and losing states.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary Mechanics Working</strong>: All of the primary mechanics / resources in your game must be implemented and fully working.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explained Mechanics / Controls / Design</strong>: The game must explain the controls and mechanics of your game in some way (through gameplay or text). A player should be able to pick up the game and play without consulting any outside materials. The 1-3 minutes of game content should be short, but interesting. Try to highlight your mechanics and what makes them fun.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start Screen</strong>: Your game needs to have some kind of start screen. The player should not be simply dropped into the middle of gameplay right away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Animations / Simple Effects</strong>: All animations / basic effects should be implemented. this includes things like animations of playable characters and NPCs, simple effects needed for your primary mechanics (e.g., light effect for a mechanic based on lighting up platforms),</p></li>
</ol>
