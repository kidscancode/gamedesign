CS4730 - Project Part 2: Alpha Build / Playable Demo
===============================

<a name="background"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

For the second part of your project, you will be developing a short, playable demo of your build. The overall goal is to produce a **fully playable game** from start to finish. The game will be short however. This means that all of your primary mechanics will be fully implemented and working. Your game will have a start screen, winning and losing conditions, etc.

A reasonable litmus test for what we expect is this: *Imagine you are releasing a free demo version of your game to entice players to purchase the full version. This alpha build should serve as a short playable demo that serves this purpose*. Here are some examples of what this might mean:

- **for a platforming game like Mario**: A start screen, a short narrative hook (e.g., "they took the princess!"), and one or two fully playable levels.
- **for a Pokemon type game**: A start screen, collect one pokemon, fight one or two battles, conclude somehow.
- **for a puzzle game**: Start screen, and 3 or 4 short puzzle levels.
- **for a metroid-like game**: Start screen, a room or two showing obstacles, one power-up pickup, overcome an obstacle and reach an ending room (with perhaps a short "boss battle").

<a name="required"></a>Requirements
---------------------------------------

The graders will be checking that the following requirements are met for your game. You will pass this assignment if all of these are implemented to a reasonable level.

1. **Fully Playable Game**: Your game needs to be a fully playable game. We expect your games at this point to be short (maybe 1-3 minutes of gameplay total). However, the game should be fully completable from beginning to end, including final win and losing states. 

2. **Primary Mechanics Working**: All of the primary mechanics / resources in your game must be implemented and fully working. 

3. **Explained Mechanics / Controls / Design**: The game must explain the controls and mechanics of your game in some way (through gameplay or text). A player should be able to pick up the game and play without consulting any outside materials. The 1-3 minutes of game content should be short, but interesting. Try to highlight your mechanics and what makes them fun.

3. **Start Screen**: Your game needs to have some kind of start screen. The player should not be simply dropped into the middle of gameplay right away.

4. **Animations / Simple Effects**: All animations / basic effects should be implemented. this includes animations of playable characters / important NPCs and simple effects needed for your primary mechanics (e.g., light effect for a mechanic based on lighting up platforms). This does **NOT** include polish effects like extra animations, particle effects, animating static background objects, etc.
