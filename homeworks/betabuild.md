CS4730 - Project Part 1: Design Document
===============================

<a name="background"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

For this assignment, you will be creating a design document for the game you will be creating with your group. This design document is not meant to be an exhaustive description of your game. However, it is meant to describe the primary mechanics of your game, and give you a chance to argue for the overall design. 

You will submit a pdf document describing the elements of your game (see the list of requirements below). 

<a name="required"></a>Requirements
---------------------------------------


Your document must contain the following information:

1. **High Level Description**: An overview of your game. What kind of game is it? A platformer? RPG? Puzzle Game? Give us a high-level overview of the game and what it is about. What is the goal of the game? What happens when you win/lose? etc.

2. **Primary Mechanic(s)**: Your game should have one or two primary mechanics that you will explore. Try to think of simple mechanics that can be used in a variety of interesting levels / situations / ways. For example, you might make a game with two controllable characters that need to interact with each other to solve puzzles (e.g., Thomas Was Alone) or a game about platforms that you can't stand on unless you shine light on them. Try to think of a single simple concept and think about how you might be able to roll with that. Also, **be as concrete as possible**. Students run into trouble when they start saying *we might do X, or maybe throw in something like Y*. 

	- **NOTE**: Some game ideas that are somewhat common that do not work well because they are too big and ambitious:
		- Monster collecting games (e.g., Pokemon or similar)
		- Games with complicated stories and branching paths with different outcomes
		- RPGs with complicated battle systems.
		- Procedurally generated games (students can usually do it, but they levels end up not being very interesting).
		- Fighting games (e.g., Super Smash Bros), though this one could potentially be done well if the scope is limited significantly.

3. **Example Uses of Mechanics**: Provide at least two examples of how your primary mechanics can be used to create interesting gameplay scenarios. Please provide images / drawings of these scenarios (they can be crude, but need to be clear).

3. **MDA**: Talk, for a few paragraphs, about the *MDA* of your game. What dynamics might emerge from your mechanics. Is that what you want? Why or why not? What is the overall aesthetic of your game? How do the mechanics and dynamics lead to this aesthetic?

4. **Formal Elements**: List out the *Formal Elements* of your game one by one. Describe each in detail (many of these can be short).
