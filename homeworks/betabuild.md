CS4730 - Project Part 3: Beta Build
===============================

<a name="background"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

For this assignment, you will be taking your alpha build and extending it by adding more content and more features. These instructions are a high-level description of what your game needs, because each game is unique. Due to this variability, you might want to contact an instructor or TA to discuss how each requirement might work within the context of your particular game.

The requirements below list four **required features** and four **other features**. For this build, you must complete **all of the required features** and **at least one of the other features**. Your submission should include a README.txt file that explains the features that were added to your game and how they satisfy the requirements below. This will help the grader focus on the features of your game and get you feedback on your submission more quickly.



<a name="required"></a>Requirements
---------------------------------------


The graders will be checking that the following requirements are met for your game. You will pass this assignment if you have all of the required features and at least two of the optional features:

**REQUIRED FEATURES**

0. **Alpha build complete**: Complete the requirements for the alpha build if you haven't done so already. You cannot pass this assignment unless your alpha build has passed first.

1. **Fully Playable Game**: Your game needs to be a fully playable game. We expect your games at this point to be longer than your alpha build (maybe 4-8 minutes of gameplay total). However, the game should be fully completable from beginning to end, including final win and losing states. 

2. **Extra Content**: Your game should have at least twice as much content as your alpha build (e.g., If your alpha build had two levels, your beta should have four). You can also measure this with time (e.g., if your alpha is 3 minutes to complete, your beta should take 6 minutes to complete). You can also measure this with rooms / enemies / bosses (e.g., if your alpha has 4 rooms with 2 types of enemies and 1 boss your beta should double each of these).

3. **Pause Screen**: Your game should have some kind of pause ability. The pause menu should display pertinent information relevant to your game (this is game dependent, so we can't really be more specific here). Your pause menu should provide the player the ability to quit the game and return to the start screen if they wish. The pause also needs to display the game controls to the player for reference.

4. **Music and SFX**: Your game should now include music and sound effects. Your game must have at least two background music tracks that play in different situations (maybe overworld versus battle music, normal vs boss music, etc.). Your game also must have at least 8 different sound effects. These can include sounds for jumping, striking, bumping into objects, enemy movements / moves, interacting with objects (e.g., pickup a rock or swipe a bush), shooting, etc. Each sound effect needs to be a unique sound.


**OTHER FEATURES (Choose two. These do not count towards your individual optional points grade)**

1. **Additional Minor Mechanics (Optional)**: It might be the case that while play-testing, you've thought of new (minor) mechanics that might make your game more interesting. Implement these new mechanics into your beta build. Make sure the design of your game explains these mechanics through gameplay. DO NOT add major mechanics (like a new battle system, extra characters, etc.). We are talking about minor things like one extra type of interactable object (maybe door switches on walls, or adding a double jump, etc.).

2. **Enhanced Start Screen**: Your start screen should now include extra options. This should include changing music and SFX volumes, 

3. **Narrative Elements**: Add additional narrative elements to your game. This can include text boxes that tell a simple story throughout gameplay, one or two short cutscenes, or visual storytelling.

4. **Add More Animations / Simple Effects**: Add at least 5 new animations or special effects to your games. This can include animating background objects like trees and clouds, adding particle effects (dust when character lands on ground, particles from enemies being knocked out, small torch fire effects, etc.).
