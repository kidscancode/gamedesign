<h2 id="github-assignment-link"><a name="background"></a>Github Assignment Link</h2>
<p>Every assignment has a <strong>Github Classroom Link</strong> you must follow to get the starter code (if applicable) and to create your repository for the assignment. If you haven’t yet done so, follow the instructions at the <a href="./githubclassroom.html">Github Classroom Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Invite Link</strong>: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/RsqGxmtY">Homework 5 Invite</a></p>
<p>Once your repository is configured, push your code to it in order to submit your work.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-resources"><a name="background"></a>Background and Resources</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will produce small demos that show basic functionality for menus, simple events (opening a door), and UI elements. You might want to peruse the following resources as you work on your assignment:</p>

<h2 id="required-features-3-features-33-to-pass"><a name="required"></a>Required Features (3 features, 3/3 to pass)</h2>
<p>These required features are meant to force you to implement very simple versions of common game elements. These can easily be expanded to more complicated elements in your game projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Menu</strong>
<ul>
<li>Open the <code>MainMenu</code> scene and create a menu around the template Canvas which must include:
<ul>
<li>Title Text (anything you want!)</li>
<li>Play Button (opens the <code>Game</code> scene when pressed)
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>SceneLoader</code> object’s <code>SceneLoader.cs</code> script to load a new scene.</li>
<li>Note: Scenes needed to be added to the build settings to be able to switch to them (Ctrl+Shift+B)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Volume Slider (adjust music volume)</li>
<li>Credits Button (opens new UI panel showing credits for the game. That’s you!)
<ul>
<li>Should have a back button to go back to the Main UI</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Opening Door</strong>
<ul>
<li>Open the <code>Door</code> scene. In it, a box is suspended above a button and there is a door on the right. When you press play, the box will fall on the button. Modify the <code>PressurePlate.cs</code> script on the Button and add a UnityEvent to trigger when the plate is pressed down and when it stops being pressed down.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>Open()</code> and <code>Close()</code> functions in the <code>Door.cs</code> script on the door GameObject to open and close the door respectively in any manner you wish.</li>
<li>Set the <code>Open()</code> and <code>Close()</code> functions as subscribers to the PressurePlate <code>Down</code> and <code>Up</code> events respectively.</li>
<li>Note: public void UnityEvents (ones with no parameters) will appear in the Inspector window, and you can subscribe events directly there instead of in code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Counting Jumps</strong>
<ul>
<li>Open the <code>JumpCounting</code> scene. In it, a box jumps every time you press space.</li>
<li>Add a UI element for indicating the number of jumps.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>JumpyBox.cs</code> script on the Box GameObject
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>UnityEvent&lt;int&gt;</code> and an integer to count the number of jumps.</li>
<li>Every time the player pressed space, the jump counter should go up, and the jump event should be triggered passing in the new jump count.</li>
<li>Subscribe the UI to the event to update its text every time a jump occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-features"><a name="optional"></a>Optional Features</h2>
<p>There are 8 optional points available through this assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Event System (2 points)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using UnityEvents, create your own event system using C# events and delegates</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Custom UI (2 points)</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can replace the sprites on all UI elements in Unity. After a while, the default Unity UI gets really boring and lame. Find some cool UI assets online or make your own and replace all the default UI in the <code>MainMenu</code> scene.</li>
<li>(UI is the first thing people see in your game, so make sure its good!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Audio Mixing (1 point)</strong>
<ul>
<li>AudioMixers are a really useful asset that are used to adjust an entire channel/group of audio sources at once (i.e. master volume). They can even add effects!</li>
<li>Create a new <code>AudioMixer</code> asset and adjust its volume instead of directly changing the volume of the music.</li>
<li>Check out the documentation on AudioMixers for more details as to how they work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scene Transitions (2 points)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modify the <code>SceneLoader</code> GameObject
<ul>
<li>Add a child <code>Image</code> UI component, set its sprite to a basic square, set the color to black, and have it <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1250052/set-the-ui-image-to-fit-screen-size.html">fill the entire screen</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modify the <code>SceneLoader.cs</code> script
<ul>
<li>Instead of just setting the new scene, setup a coroutine to fade the screen out, then switch scenes, then fade the screen in.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Text Mesh Pro (1 point)</strong>
<ul>
<li>For all applicable UI elements, use TextMeshPro (TMP) instead of the standard UI.</li>
<li>The difference is that TMP converts UI to a mesh, allowing it to scale infinitely without getting blurry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
