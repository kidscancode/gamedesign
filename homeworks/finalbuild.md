CS4730 - Project Part 4: Final Build
===============================

<a name="background"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

It is here! The final boss...uh...build!! Your game is almost complete. Let's finish it up! For this build, you will first ensure that the requirements for your Beta build are complete. You will then polish your game by adding at least 10 concrete improvements.



<a name="required"></a>Requirements
---------------------------------------

**Step 1: Complete Requirements through Beta**: If, for any reason, you did not reach your goals for the beta build, then complete those requirements first. You cannot pass this final build step unless you have complete those requirements first.

**Step 2: List out ten improvements to your game**

The overall goal of your final build is to add bug fixes, improvements, polish, etc. to your game so it is as good as it can be for our final game expo. First make a list of at least 10 improvements that can be made to the game. Each improvement should be in one of the following categories (see list below). Make sure your list is submitted so the grader knows what improvements to look for in your final build. You can include multiple items from each category below (within reason).

Some types of improvements include, but are not necessarily limited to (*Note: These are in a rough order of how you should prioritize them*):

-  *Show stopping bug fixes*: Does your game have any show stopping bugs (these are bugs that crash the game, prevent the player from continuing, etc.). If so, identify them, and add them to your list.

- *Minor bug fixes*: If your game has minor bugs (noticeable, but you can still play through the game technically), then list them out and fix them.

- *Additional content*: Add more content to your game. You can count this as one item per level / room / significant piece of content. If necessary, negotiate with your TA or instructor about what constitutes enough "additional content". You should **NOT** be adding new mechanics (new weapons, status effects, power-ups, etc.).

- *More dialogue / narrative*: Similar to extra content. Add more story to your game. This can be additinal dialogue through characters, or an additional cutscene.

- *Additional animations*: Add animations to breath life into your game. This can be as simple as animating background trees, clouds, bushes, or other environmental objects. This is a great way to make your game come to life a little bit without too much effort.

- *Add particle effects*: Add more simple particle effects to breathe some life into your game. 

- *Add light effects*: Add simple lighting effects to make your game look better. 


**Step 3: Implement Requirements and Improvements**

Lastly, take your finished beta build and your list of improvements and implement each of the given improvements. Make sure to submit your fully working build as well as the list of improvements you chose to add.
