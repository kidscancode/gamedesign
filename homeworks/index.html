<h2 id="due-dates"><a name="introduction"></a>Due Dates</h2>
<p>The due dates for assignments are different depending on the type of assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Required individual assignments</strong> have <em>recommended due dates</em> for each, but these are flexible. The hard deadline for all required individual assignments is <strong>October 31, 2020 at 11:59pm</strong>. This is at the 2/3rds point in the course and was chosen so that you might shift focus to your group project at this point. See the course calendar (or below) for recommended deadlines for each individual homework.</p>
<p><strong>Group Project Parts</strong> have traditional hard deadlines. This is because group requires a stricter level of accountability across members of the group. The due dates for each project part are in the course calendar and also below.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Individual Assignment Components</strong> have completely flexible deadlines, and are all due at the end of the semester. The due date is the last day of class, <strong>Tuesday, November 24 at 11:59pm</strong>. You are <em>highly encouraged</em> to submit optional components early so you can get them out of the way and know where you stand in the course as early as possible.</p>

Additionally, each assignment has multiple individual optional components that can be completed at will. This setup allows students to choose which optional components they would like to tackle depending on their interests. Each optional component is an individually graded task, the points for which are pooled together across all homeworks to determine your optional points grade.</p>
