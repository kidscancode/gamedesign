<p>The repository contains content for CS4730 - Game Design at <a href="https://virginia.edu">the University of Virginia</a>. This is a fully online course due to the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. The course will consist of online lectures (via Zoom), several homework assignments (to learn and use the <a href="https://www.unity.com">Unity Game Engine</a>), and a group project developing a fully playable game.</p>

<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>Introduces the development and design of modern video games. Includes the description and implementation of a 2-dimensional game engine (including sprite graphics, linear transformations, display trees, etc). Introduces concepts in video game design, including designing for teaching game mechanics, the distinction between mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, and pacing through levels / level design. Students complete the implementation of their game engine and then proceed to build a fully playable game in the engine they have created.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a> course objectives are below. Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and implement a basic 2-dimensional game engine.</li>
<li>Increase understanding of game and level design, including how visual and auditory cues contribute to teaching a player the game mechanics of the system.</li>
<li>Implement a fully playable game, including all aspects of the software lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, etc.).</li>
</ul>
