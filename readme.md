Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only, to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a lecture.  However, others can still contribute to this repository -- to do so, take the following steps:

1. Create a github account, if you do not have one
2. Fork this repository: you can click on the "Fork" link in the upper right, or just click [here](https://github.com/markfloryan/dsa2/fork)
3. Clone your forked repository on to your local machine
4. Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and push your changes back to your forked repository
5. Create a pull request, following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

At that point, I will receive a notice that a change has been submitted, and I'll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main repository.

<a name="description"></a>Course Description
--------------------------------------------

Introduces the development and design of modern video games. Includes the description and implementation of a 2-dimensional game engine (including sprite graphics, linear transformations, display trees, etc). Introduces concepts in video game design, including designing for teaching game mechanics, the distinction between mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, and pacing through levels / level design. Students complete the implementation of their game engine and then proceed to build a fully playable game in the engine they have created.

The [ABET](http://www.abet.org) course objectives are below. Students will be able to:
 
- Understand and implement a basic 2-dimensional game engine.
- Increase understanding of game and level design, including how visual and auditory cues contribute to teaching a player the game mechanics of the system.
- Implement a fully playable game, including all aspects of the software lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, etc.).
