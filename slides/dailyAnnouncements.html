### Quiz Issues

- There were no quizzes in lab on Tuesday. I see 3 solutions:
  - Cancel this week's quizzes (I HATE this option)
  - Adjust grading scheme (also hate this option)
  - Provide an optional makeup time (I think this one is best)
- Friday will be half-lecture and half-quiz.
- I'm building in some safeguards so this shouldn't happen again.

- Quizzes have been returned. Don't worry that your "average" looks really bad.
- Homeworks have all been graded (except for 10'ish recent blackjacks)
- Quiz 3 (Basic Java 3) is available in lab this week.
- You should be close to finishing blackjack at this point. I've only seen 31 Roombas, which is not great.
- Today we will go over how a vector works! First real data structure!

- Submitted assignments have been graded
  - If you received a 0 for power(), you probably didn't check exp=0 case. quick fix and we'll get that checked off for you (maybe do this in lab!!)

  - Goal is to have those graded by Thursday evening, maybe Friday if something goes haywire
- Module 2 is officially released. Let me know if you have any questions.
